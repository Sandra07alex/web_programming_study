# Web Programming Study
This repository contains basic web development files created using HTML, CSS, JS, and PHP. These files were developed during my study of web programming to explore various core concepts and roles involved in web development. While not structured as full-fledged projects, these files serve as hands-on learning tools, helping me grasp essential web development skills.
